<a href="https://rhinehartadvancedenglish.weebly.com/uploads/2/2/1/0/22108252/the-complete-persepolis-by.pdf"> Persepolis </a> is the story of Marjane Satrapi a young Iranian girl who has too live through the Iranian Revolution of 1979. The story starts at the beginning of the revolution itself when Marjane is just ten years old, and how everything started to change suddenly in front of her eyes. We see how the schools change, now dividing boys and girls, and how women are being forced to wear a veil that covers their heads. We follow her new life as we learn how the revolution imposed laws that restricted many freedoms. We also see how there are many people being tortured and killled for crimes they did not commit, even some people Marjane knew like her uncle. We keep upwith Marjane as the Iran-Iraq war starts and it ravages the country with F-14s in the air and bombs dropping the world is a chaotic place, more so little boys are forced to fight in the war in exchange for a way to paradise. The book ends when Marjanes parents decide to send her to Austria to have a better education and also be safer than in Iran. Persepolis is like an autobiography of sorts detailing the childhood of Marjane until she was forced to grow up by forces out of her own control.
