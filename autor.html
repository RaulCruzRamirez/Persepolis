<p>
<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjane_Satrapi"> Marjane Satrapi </a> was born on the 22 of November of 1969 in Rasht, Iran. She had studied in a french non-religious school but that had been shut down because of the government. She saw both the revolution and the Iran-Iraq war both of which are seen in her book. It was only when she was 14 that her parents decided that she should leave Iran in search of a better education which she found in Austria. After she had finished her education she decided to leave for France in which she resides still. It was only when David Beuchard, a cartoonist and screenwriter, had suggested to her that she should narrate her childhood that Persepolis was created. She also directed an animated movie based on the book.
